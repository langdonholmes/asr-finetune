# Finetuning ASR Models for Child Voices

## Major Steps

1. Report performance of base Whisper models on child voice datasets
2. Finetune models on child voice datasets
3. Report performance of finetuned models on different datasets of child voices
4. Compare baseline performance (#1) and finetuned performance (#2) to performance results reported for adult voice datasets in previous work
